# This script will look in a specific domain for users
# and see if they have a specific office 365 license

# the single good license unless they have a department
# set so you can filter out service accounts or similar
# We also ignore any account who has a password set to
# not expire (like disabled accounts)
# For those with the single good license, we check that
# all of the options (Lync, Office etc) are enabled
# as that can also cause problems.  It will report any
# that are disabled
